[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kubeapps/kubeapps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kubeapps/kubeapps)

[Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com) is a web-based UI for deploying and managing applications in Kubernetes clusters. Kubeapps allows you to:

- Browse and deploy [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) charts from chart repositories
- Inspect, upgrade and delete Helm-based applications installed in the cluster
- Add custom and private chart repositories (supports [ChartMuseum](https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum) and [JFrog Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Helm+Chart+Repositories))
- Browse and provision external services from the [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) and available Service Brokers
- Connect Helm-based applications to external services with Service Catalog Bindings
- Secure authentication and authorization based on Kubernetes [Role-Based Access Control](docs/user/access-control.md)

## TL;DR;

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install --name kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

It also packages the [Bitnami MongoDB chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/mongodb) which is required for bootstrapping a MongoDB deployment for the database requirements of the Kubeapps application.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.8+ (tested with Azure Kubernetes Service, Google Kubernetes Engine, minikube and Docker for Desktop Kubernetes)
- Helm 2.9.1+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- Administrative access to the cluster to create and update RBAC ClusterRoles

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `kubeapps`:

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install --name kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps
```

The command deploys Kubeapps on the Kubernetes cluster in the `kubeapps` namespace. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Upgrading Kubeapps

To upgrade Kubeapps, first ensure you have the updated your local chart repository cache:

```console
$ helm repo update
```

Now upgrade Kubeapps:

```console
$ export RELEASE_NAME=kubeapps
$ export NAMESPACE=kubeapps
$ export MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace $NAMESPACE $RELEASE_NAME-mongodb -o jsonpath="{.data.mongodb-root-password}" | base64 --decode)
$ helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME bitnami/kubeapps --set mongodb.mongodbRootPassword=$MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

The above commands ensure the MongoDB password is set to the existing password and not regenerated by the chart.

## Uninstalling Kubeapps

To uninstall/delete the `kubeapps` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete --purge kubeapps
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

For a full list of configuration parameters of the Kubeapps chart, see the [values.yaml](values.yaml) file.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
$ helm install --name kubeapps --namespace kubeapps \
  --set chartsvc.service.port=9090 \
    bitnami/kubeapps
```

The above command sets the port for the chartsvc Service to 9090.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
$ helm install --name kubeapps --namespace kubeapps -f custom-values.yaml bitnami/kubeapps
```

### Configuring Initial Repositories

By default, Kubeapps will track the [community Helm charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) and the [Kubernetes Service Catalog charts](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog). To change these defaults, override the `apprepository.initialRepos` object:

```console
$ cat > custom-values.yaml <<EOF
apprepository:
  initialRepos:
  - name: example
    url: https://charts.example.com
EOF
$ helm install --name kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps -f custom-values.yaml
```

### Exposing Externally

#### LoadBalancer Service

The simplest way to expose the Kubeapps Dashboard is to assign a LoadBalancer type to the Kubeapps frontend Service. For example:

```console
$ helm install --name kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps --set frontend.service.type=LoadBalancer
```

Wait for your cluster to assign a LoadBalancer IP or Hostname to the `kubeapps` Service and access it on that address:

```console
$ kubectl get services --namespace kubeapps --watch
```

#### Ingress

This chart provides support for ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/nginx-ingress) or [traefik](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/traefik) you can utilize the ingress controller to expose Kubeapps.

To enable ingress integration, please set `ingress.enabled` to `true`

##### Hosts

Most likely you will only want to have one hostname that maps to this Kubeapps installation, however, it is possible to have more than one host.  To facilitate this, the `ingress.hosts` object is an array.

##### Annotations

For annotations, please see [this document](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/annotations.md). Not all annotations are supported by all ingress controllers, but this document does a good job of indicating which annotation is supported by many popular ingress controllers. Annotations can be set using `ingress.annotations`.

##### TLS

TLS can be configured using the `ingress.tls` object in the same format that the Kubernetes Ingress requests. Please see [this example](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx/examples/tls) for more information.
