# The Kubeapps Overview

This document describes the Kubeapps architecture at a high level.

## Components

### Kubeapps installer

The Kubeapps installer is a command-line tool for installing, upgrading and uninstalling the Kubeapps in-cluster components. The tool is written in the Go programming language and the Kubernetes manifests are written in the Jsonnet data templating language.

### Kubeapps dashboard

At the heart of Kubeapps is a in-cluster Kubernetes dashboard that provides you a simple browse and click experience for installing applications packaged as Helm charts. It also provides you a simple and easy to use web interface to develop, test and deploy Kubeless functions.

Additionally, the dashboard integrates with the [Kubernetes service catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) and enables you to browse and provision cloud services via the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker).

The dashboard is written in the Javascript programming language and is developed using the React Javascript library.

### Tiller proxy

In order to secure the access to tiller and allow the dashboard to contact the Helm tiller server we deploy a proxy that handles the communication with Tiller. The goal of this proxy is to validate that the user doing the request has sufficent permissions to create or delete all the resources.

This proxy is also written in Go. Check more details about the implementation in this [document](/cmd/tiller-proxy/README.md).

### Kubeless

[Kubeless](http://kubeless.io/) is a Kubernetes-native serverless framework that lets you deploy small bits of code (functions) without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. It leverages Kubernetes resources to provide auto-scaling, API routing, monitoring, troubleshooting and more.

Kubeless is also written in the Go programming language and it is developed independently of Kubeapps at [kubeless/kubeless](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless).
