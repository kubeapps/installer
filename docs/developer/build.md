## Build kubeapps

Kubeapps consists of a number of in-cluster components. To build all these components in one go:

```bash
make VERSION=myver all
```

Or if you wish to build specific component(s):

```bash
# to build the kubeapps binary
make VERSION=myver kubeapps

# to build the kubeapps/dashboard docker image
make VERSION=myver kubeapps/dashboard

# to build the kubeapps/chartsvc docker image
make VERSION=myver kubeapps/chartsvc

# to build the kubeapps/chart-repo docker image
make VERSION=myver kubeapps/chart-repo

# to build the kubeapps/apprepository-controller docker image
make VERSION=myver kubeapps/apprepository-controller

# to build the kubeapps/tiller-proxy docker image
make VERSION=myver kubeapps/tiller-proxy
```

## Running tests

To test all the components:

```bash
make test
```

Or if you wish to test specific component(s):

```bash
# to test the kubeapps binary
make test-kubeapps

# to test kubeapps/dashboard
make test-dashboard

# to test the cmd/chartsvc package
make test-chartsvc

# to test the cmd/chart-repo package
make test-chart-repo

# to test the cmd/apprepository-controller package
make test-apprepository-controller

# to test the cmd/tiller-proxy package
make test-tiller-proxy
```
